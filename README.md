### What I learned

While learning about web development responsiveness, I learned that media query is a technique that allows me to adapt the appearance and layout of my website or application to different screen sizes and devices. Using CSS syntax, I can define specific rules for different screen resolutions, based on criteria such as screen width, device orientation, and pixel density.

Inserting this information in the README.md file of my project is a great practice because it helps other developers understand how I made my website or application responsive, showing that I care about accessibility and usability on different devices. By sharing this knowledge, I am contributing to the web development community and promoting best development practices.
